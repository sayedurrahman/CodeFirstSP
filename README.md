# Code First with Stored Procedures

Code First is a blessing because it allows for continued development on a fresh database. It drops the database and recreates it with the updated model. However, when it comes to using stored procedures with Code First, support is minimal.

This project demonstrates how to use stored procedures with Code First without relying on any migrations.
